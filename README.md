# Forms-project-with-JS
This was my first solo project where I validated my knowledge of JS.

It isn't responsive but responsiveness wasn't my main goal here. The main goal was rounding up the knowledge I gathered by watching courses and tutorials and doing simple projects represented in the "3d0 learning Javascript" repository. I didn't know what clean code was while coding this, so don't be mad. For storing data I used indexedDb.
