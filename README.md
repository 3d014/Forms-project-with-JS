# Forms-project-with-JS
This was my first solo project where I validated my knowledge of JS. 

It isn't responsive but responsivnes wasn't my main goal here. Main goal was rounding up knowledge I gathered by watching courses and tutorials and doing simple projects that are represented in "3d0 learining Javascript" repository.
I didn't know what clean code actually was while I was coding this so don't be mad. 
For storing data I used indexedDb.
